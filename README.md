This repo contains the codes used to implement the force-impedance controller developed in port-Hamiltonian framework. The ROS development enviroment is developed by the DTPA grounp of University of Groningen.

The controller is implemented under: `src⁩ ▸ ⁨pera⁩ ▸ ⁨pera_control⁩ ▸ ⁨src⁩ ▸ ⁨pera_control⁩ ▸ pera_controller_velpid.py` and can be found in the function called `parallelControlPH()`.

The main call can be found under: `src⁩ ▸ ⁨pera⁩ ▸ ⁨pera_control⁩ ▸ ⁨bin⁩ ▸ ⁨pera_wrist`
